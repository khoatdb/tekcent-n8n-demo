# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the XXX.AI platform, ensuring quality, reliability, and security.

## 1. BDD Scenario Organization by Epic

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) will be used to align development with business requirements. The following Gherkin scenarios, derived from the project plan, will form the basis of our automated end-to-end tests.

### EPIC-1 Scenarios

- **`TC-2`: Customer Registration** (US-2)
  ```gherkin
  Given a user visits the registration page
  When they enter valid registration details
  Then a new account is created
  And the user receives a confirmation email
  ```
- **`TC-1`: Company Formation** (US-5)
  ```gherkin
  Given a customer is logged in to the portal
  When they initiate the company formation workflow
  And they fill in all required details
  Then the company formation request is submitted for approval
  ```
- **`TC-3`: Document Upload** (US-4)
  ```gherkin
  Given a customer is logged in to the portal
  When they upload a document
  Then the document is stored securely in their dedicated space
  And the customer can see the document in their file list
  ```

### EPIC-2 Scenarios

- **`TC-4`: Company Approval** (US-7)
  ```gherkin
  Given an administrator is logged in
  And there is a pending company formation request
  When they approve the request
  Then the request status is updated to 'approved'
  And the customer is notified of the approval
  ```
- **`TC-6`: Document Scanning** (US-9)
  ```gherkin
  Given a staff member is logged in
  When they scan a physical document
  Then the document is digitized and uploaded to the correct customer's storage
  And the document text is extracted via OCR
  ```

### EPIC-3 Scenarios

- **`TC-7`: AI Chatbot Query** (US-11)
  ```gherkin
  Given a customer is logged in to the portal
  When they ask the chatbot "Who are my company shareholders?"
  Then the chatbot provides an accurate list of shareholders from their indexed data
  ```
- **`TC-8`: AI Agent Compliance Alert** (US-12)
  ```gherkin
  Given an AI agent is monitoring a company's compliance data
  When the agent detects a potential compliance issue
  Then a notification is sent to the customer detailing the issue
  And the agent provides recommendations for resolution
  ```

## 2. Test Automation Approach

Our strategy employs a multi-layered testing pyramid:

- **Unit Tests**: Written in the same language as the service code (e.g., Jest for frontend, Pytest for Python backend). They will validate individual functions and components in isolation. All business logic within N8N nodes should be unit tested where possible.
- **Integration Tests**: These will test the connections between components. Examples:
  - API Gateway -> N8N workflow trigger.
  - N8N workflow -> SharePoint document creation.
  - N8N workflow -> SendGrid API call.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: These tests will automate the BDD scenarios using a framework like **Cypress** or **Playwright**. They will simulate real user interactions in a browser against a deployed staging environment.

## 3. Quality Gates and Acceptance Criteria

To maintain high quality, the following gates must be passed before code is merged to the `main` branch:

- **Pull Request (PR) Gate**: 
  - All unit and integration tests must pass.
  - Code coverage must not decrease (target >90%).
  - Static code analysis (e.g., SonarQube) must not report new critical issues.
  - Successful peer review/approval.
- **Staging Deployment Gate**:
  - The full E2E test suite (automating BDD scenarios) must pass against the staging environment.
  - Manual exploratory testing on new features is complete.
  - Performance and security scans are completed and reviewed.

## 4. Performance and Security Testing

- **Performance Testing**: Load testing will be conducted on critical user journeys before major releases, focusing on:
  - `POST /auth/login` (Login throughput)
  - `POST /documents` (Concurrent document uploads)
  - `POST /workflows/company-formation` (Workflow initiation)
- **Security Testing**:
  - **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
  - **Penetration Testing** will be conducted on high-risk features, especially:
    - Authentication and session management (TS-2).
    - E-approval and digital signature process (TS-8).
    - Cross-tenant data access to ensure customer data isolation in SharePoint and the AI platform.
